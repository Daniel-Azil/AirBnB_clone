# Airbnb Clone Project

This is a phase of the Airbnb Clone project, which focuses on the HTML and CSS part. The project aims to replicate the look and feel of the Airbnb website. It includes various components such as the header, footer, filters, and places section, styled with CSS. The project also uses icons and images from the "Images" folder to enhance the visual appeal.

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- **Images:** This folder contains icons and images used in the project, including the logo, bathroom icons, bedroom icons, and guest icons.

- **Styles:** The CSS styling files are located here. The highest-numbered style file for each category (e.g., common, footer, header, places) is the most relevant to the finished product.

- **index.html:** The highest-numbered `index.html` file represents the most relevant version of the project's HTML structure.

## Usage

To view the project, you can simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The HTML and CSS in this phase of the project create a user interface resembling Airbnb's website.
